IVy is a research tool intended to allow interactive development of
protocols and their proofs of correctness and to provide a platform
for developing and experimenting with automated proof techniques. In
particular, IVy provides interactive visualization of automated
proofs, and supports a use model in which the human protocol designer
and the automated tool interact to expose errors and prove
correctness.

Abstract

While the problem of mechanized proof of liveness of reactive programs has been studied for decades, there is currently no method of proving liveness that is conceptually simple to apply in practice to realistic problems, can be scaled to large problems without modular decomposition, and does not fail unpredictably due to the use of fragile heuristics. We introduce a method of liveness proof by relational rankings, implement it, and show that it meets these criteria in a realistic industrial case study involving a model of the memory subsystem in a CPU.
